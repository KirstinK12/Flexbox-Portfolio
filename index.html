        <h2>Hello! I'm Kirstin Kirk.</h2>
        <p>I am currently living in Denver, Colorado with my fiance, Zander, and our dog, Neiko. I am originally from Michigan, but made my dream move to Colorado in 2017. I am a nature lover at heart and have always wanted to live closer to the mountains.</p>
        <p>Something that I think make me special is that I am a former collegiate athlete. I played volleyball for four years, where I really learned the lesson of team work and accountability. I think these skills translate well to my working professional career. </p>

<!-- PASSION FOR WEB DEV -->

      <h2>Why web development?</h2>
        <div class="group">
          <div class="item">
        <p>I am currently studying to be a web developer with Bloc. I started my journey with Bloc because I wanted to pursue a new career path after feeling stuck in my current role. The thing that made me interested in web development is just how important it has become to our everyday lives. Whenever we want to look something up or buy something now a days, where do we turn? <strong> The web.</strong></p>

        <p>Another thing that stood out to me with web development was how much growth the industry has seen. I look forward to working with new people in the field whom have been there through that growth and have learned how to adapt to this ever-changing industry. Having a team that you can turn to when a project is stuck or not turning out how you pictured will be essential to providing the best results.</p>

        <p>Outside of learning to code, I spend most of my free time in the mountains. I enjoy spending my days hiking new areas. I also enjoy capturing my adventures in photographs.
